### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Developer who Studied Systems Engineer and Graduated at Pearson/Eduvos, I also have a passion for Building and Deploying Apps/Websites. I really enjoy the backend of building apps more - People call me a bug, But I'm a feature! . Full Stack Developer with a passion for coding, a love for learning new technologies and a knack for debugging. I believe that code is poetry and that the only thing better than solving a problem is solving it with a well-crafted function
