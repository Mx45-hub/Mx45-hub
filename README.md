### 🧠 About Me
- ⚙️ I enjoy the **backend** side of development — APIs, logic, and architecture are my playground.  
- 🐞 People call me a bug... but I like to think I’m a **feature**.  
- 🚀 Always learning something new — currently diving deeper into **microservices** and **scalable system design**.  
- 🧩 I believe **code is poetry**, and the best kind of poetry runs at `O(1)` complexity.  
- ☕ Fuelled by **coffee**, **curiosity**, and the occasional late-night debug session.
