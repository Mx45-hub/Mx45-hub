### Hey there 👋

I'm **MJ**, a passionate **Full Stack Developer** and **Systems Engineering graduate** from **Pearson Institute (Eduvos)**.  
I love building, deploying, and optimizing modern web applications that actually *do something useful* — not just look pretty.

💻 **Tech Stack:**  
`HTML` · `CSS` · `JavaScript` · `Java (Spring Boot)` · `Node.js` · `SQL` · `Flutter` · `TailwindCSS` · `Astro`

### 🧠 About Me
- ⚙️ I enjoy the **backend** side of development — APIs, logic, and architecture are my playground.  
- 🐞 People call me a bug... but I like to think I’m a **feature**.  
- 🚀 Always learning something new — currently diving deeper into **microservices** and **scalable system design**.  
- 🧩 I believe **code is poetry**, and the best kind of poetry runs at `O(1)` complexity.  
- ☕ Fuelled by **coffee**, **curiosity**, and the occasional late-night debug session.

### 🧰 What I’m Working On
- 🏗️ Building full-stack apps using **Spring Boot + Astro + TailwindCSS**  
- ☁️ Running my own **web hosting and deployment stack** (VPS-powered)  
- 💬 Exploring AI-based automation and chat systems for businesses
